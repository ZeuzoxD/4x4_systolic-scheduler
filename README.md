# Systolic Scheduler for 4x4 Matrix Multiplication

This repository implements a **Verilog-based scheduler** for driving a **4x4 Systolic Array**, designed to perform efficient matrix multiplication.
The project was developed in two phases:
1. **Standalone Scheduler Design** – Designed and verified the functionality of the scheduler.
2. **Full Integration** – Connected the scheduler to a 4x4 Systolic Array (design by a collaborator) and verified its operation for matrix multiplication.

## Running the Simulations
### Standalone Scheduler Test

```bash
cd src
iverilog systolic_scheduler.v scheduler_tb.v -o a.out
vvp a.out
gtkwave systolic_scheduler.vcd
```

### Full System Test with 4x4 Systolic Array
```
cd systolic_env
iverilog tb_with_scheduler.v 4x4_Systolic_Array.v systolic_scheduler.v block.v -o test
./test
gtkwave systolic_debug.vcd
```

## Collaborator Acknowledgment
The 4x4 systolic array design was developed by a collaborator.
A link to their GitHub repository will be added once available.
